# react-movie-app

This is demo movie application which demonstrates setup and usage of core libraries needed for React & Redux application.

You can clone this project and run `npm install` in order to install all required dependencies.

To start application with webpack-dev-server you need to run `npm start` command in terminal. There we do a few tasks in parallel: run our server which is configured to transpile and bundle our source code, lint our code and watch for lint errors and warnings in case of files change.

Webpack-dev-server runs in memory by design, so in order to create physical output files you need to run `npm run build` command.
